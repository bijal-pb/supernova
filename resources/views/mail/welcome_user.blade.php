WOO HOO!
<br /><br />
I'm so happy you're here, <strong>{{$user->first_name}}</strong>.
<br /><br />
With this email, I confirm that your Lifelong VIP Package is reserved and will become active after the launch of this platform (mid-September).
<br />
So, what do you get?
<br />
<ol style="padding-left: 15px;">
<li><strong>Insights App.</strong> This is one of the core applications, which allows you to see the deepest level of what's going on inside the platform: your profile views, traffic sources, top experts, who recommended and shared your programs, and other data. This is a paid app that you get for FREE and FOREVER! </li>
<li><strong>Status uplift.</strong>  Sebtember uses activity status to reward the most advanced users. When a new user signs up, his/her status starts from 0 (and can go up to 100). Building a status takes time, yet the higher status, the more free features the user can access (full package worth > $300 a year) and gets paid more. You start from 20, which means you already have what others will need a year to reach.
This is my "Thank you" for your COURAGE.</li>
</ol>
<strong>{{$user->first_name}}</strong>, I guess your friends, colleagues, best clients would appreciate receiving the same package from You. Wouldn't they?
<br /><br />
Just send them the link below or share it on social media and encourage them to grab the opportunity before it's too late ( e.g. "Take a look! Should be interesting").
<br /><br />
Each Sign Up will increase your activity status, which will never decrease after that. Youâ€™ll see later that it was worth doing.
<br /><br />
This unique link is active for 14 days. Don't miss out. The winner takes it all.
